# 🌦️ Weather App (Flutter)

A simple Flutter application that fetches the **current weather** of the user’s **current location** using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
The app requests location permissions, retrieves latitude and longitude with the **Geolocator** package, and then displays temperature, weather conditions, and city name.
